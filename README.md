# Auto_Subtitler-Dubbers
This project aims to translate, dub and overlay video and audio files in other languages using modulated voices as well as subtitles for video files. This program accomplishes all this in real time, through using many different machine learning algorithms to detect when people are speaking, when mouths are moving and when mouths aren't moving (which is arguably more important).
